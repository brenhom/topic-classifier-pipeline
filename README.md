# Topic Classifier Pipeline
Brendan and Jenn

In this repo we recreate and test the results of the paper [Less is More: Parameter-Free Text Classification with Gzip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09410)

## Plans

We need
* A thing that downloads a dataset and splits it
    * We also need to get stats on the dataset
* Something that does the training on a model
* A model object
    * Training
    * Classify
    * Hyperparameter tuning (?)
* Evaluation processing/results display
* A preprocessor class
